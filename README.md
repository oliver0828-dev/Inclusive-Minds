# Inclusive-Minds
## Overview

"Inclusive Minds," a project developed for the [Swift Student Challenge 2024](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/?cid=ssc-ht). 

## Purpose

The core objective of "Inclusive Minds" is to enlighten and empower students on how to effectively confront and counteract racism within their schools. The project aims to be a resourceful platform, offering insights and strategies to students for addressing racial issues. Additionally, the app aspires to establish a connection with the SOAR team in South Korea, furthering the cause and expanding its impact.

## App Functionality

### Opening
The app greets users with a powerful visual â€“ Three Fists accompanied by the text "Inclusive Minds." This imagery sets a tone of unity and strength against racism.

### Home Page
The Home Page serves as an introductory space, providing brief yet insightful information about racism and practical approaches to address it in educational settings.

### Learn Section
The Learn Section is designed to be an educational hub where students can deepen their understanding of racism:

- **Understanding Racism:** The app includes detailed explanations of four different types of racism, highlighting their distinct characteristics and implications.
- **Interactive Learning:** Each type of racism is accompanied by a pop-up page that delves into the negative consequences associated with it.
- **Addressing Racism:** Users will find a list of 10 actionable ways to combat racism in schools. These methods are crafted to be both practical and effective, encouraging students to take an active role in fostering an inclusive environment.

## Future Developments
While the app currently focuses on educating users about racism, future updates may include direct interaction with the SOAR team. This collaboration could potentially open new avenues for learning and activism, allowing the app to serve as a bridge between students and anti-racism organizations.
